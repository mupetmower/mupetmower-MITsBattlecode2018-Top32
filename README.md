# mupetmower-MITsBattlecode2018-Top32

A bot I created in Java for MIT's 2018 Battlecode tournament. Placed in the top 32 teams. The team was called Mellow Dirt and consisted of only me. The tournament was under a month long. This bot was created in 2.5 weeks. The strategy was Ranger/Mage rush with a few Healers while Workers gathered and built rockets. All units used A-star pathfinding, optimized by sharing paths with each other.
